## MUSIC GENERATION WITH RNN - LSTM

In this project, we explore building a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) for music generation.
We trained an RNN model using 3 layers: Embeddings layer, LSTM layer, and Dense Layer to learn the patterns in raw sheet music 
in ABC notation and then use this model to generate new music.

## Introduction to TensorFlow

In this part of the MIT-6.S191, you'll get exposure to using TensorFlow and learn how it can be used for solving deep learning tasks.

TensorFlow is a software library extensively used in machine learning. Here we'll learn how computations are represented 
and how to define a simple neural network in TensorFlow. We used the latest verssion of TensorFlow, TensorFlow 2, which affords great flexibility
and the ability to imperatively execute operations, just like in Python.
